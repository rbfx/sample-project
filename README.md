# Sample project

Simple example project that uses [the Framework](https://github.com/rbfx/rbfx) as submodule.

It is automatically deployed to [itch.io](https://eugeneko.itch.io/sample-project) and it can be played in browser.

TODO: Expand this page and the sample.

## Building the Sample

Checkout and build this project like any other CMake project.

Provide `rbfx`:
- Build engine: provide `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/rbfx/CMake`
- Use engine SDK:
  - Windows: provide `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/rbfx-SDK/share`
  - Unix: provide `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/rbfx-SDK`

Check out `Scripts/` folder and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to see how this sample can be built.

## Running the Sample

Run Editor:

1) Launch `Editor.exe`;

2) Open `sample-project/Project` folder;

3) Open `Scenes/Scene.xml` in Editor;

4) Press `Ctrl+P` to play the sample.

Run Player:

Launch `Player.exe`

## Portability of Resource Access

The engine needs to somehow locate project resources on launch.

By default, the engine attempts to find `Data`, `Cache` and `CoreData` folders next to the executable.
However, this behavior may be inconvenient during development:
* `Data` and `Cache` folders are located in `Project` folder,
* `CoreData` is located in `bin` folder of `rbfx` repository,
* The executable is located somewhere in CMake build folder.

This issue can be mitigated by having `ResourceRoot.ini` file.
See the comments in `ResourceRoot.ini` file in this repository for details.
